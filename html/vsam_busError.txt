Subject: VSAM BusError

Kristi,

  The bug I found in the VSAM is that if the 24 bit portion of the VME address matches the VSAM address for a D32 cycle with the AM lines other than 39-3B OR 3D-3F (Standard A24 cycle), the VSAM will generate a BERR.

If you have an A32/D32 module at 0x80400000 and a VSAM at 0x00400000, the VSAM will generate a bus error for accesses to the other module.

I lifted U3, pin 8. This drives the BERR line to the P1 connector. The VSAM will never generate a BERR. You could also cut the trace from R1 to the P1 connector.
