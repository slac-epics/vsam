To use the VSAM software, the VxWorks kernel must be able to perform
A24/D32 accesses.  You can modify your target's kernel, if necessary,
as described below.

The following instructions are for mv167 and mv177 kernels.

Change the file <vxworks_dir>/target/config/<target>/sysLib.c as follows:

        In the function sysHwInit, in the section setting up VMEbus access,
        change the lines
             *VMECHIP2_LBSAR           |= LBSAR2_AM_STD_USR_DATA |
                                          LBSAR2_D16;
        to
             /* D16 bit must be cleared to enable D32 */
             *VMECHIP2_LBSAR           &= ~LBSAR2_D16;
             *VMECHIP2_LBSAR           |= LBSAR2_AM_STD_USR_DATA |
                                          LBSAR2_D32;

        You may also wish to change the comment a few lines above:
             *   STD (A24/D16)  0xf0000000 - 0xf0ffffff
        to
             *   STD (A24/D32)  0xf0000000 - 0xf0ffffff

and make a new kernel.
