                 VSAM VME Address Assignents
                -----------------------------

The VSAM module uses the VMEbus address A24. The VME address is selected
using onboard dip switches SW1 and SW2.

The vxWorks script VSAMInit.cmd is used to look for a block of VME
Address assigned specificially to VSAM modules. To do this the 
user needs to envoke  the funtion VSAM_init() prior to executing 
the EPICS function iocInit(). 

The function VSAM_init() assigns a card number (0-15) and
corresponding VME address to each VSAM module.
The EPICS driver then refers to the VSAM module from the database
by card number. The driver is then able obtain a cards the 
corresponding local VME bus address.

Note, that the address supplied in VSAM_init() is 
a VME system bus address, which is basically the offset
from the base address space, which in this case is A24.
The VSAM_init() software converts the specified address
in argument 1 to the local VME bus address, which is needed 
to access to the module on the bus. The initiaization
function prototype and argument specifications are listed below.

      VSAM_init(long *addr,short num,short first)

      addr  - Base A24 address (VME system bus address)
      num   - Number of cards installed in crate (0-15)
      first - First card number

Each VSAM module has 0x100 bytes of A24  I/O space.  
The following example means that 5 VSAM modules will be
looked for on the bus, with the address assignments
below:


     Example) 
    
          VSAM_init(0x400000,2,5)

         Item #      Card #     System Bus Address
        --------   ---------  ----------------------
          1           2         0x400000
          2           3         0x400100
          3           4         0x400200
          4           5         0x400300
          5           6         0x400400
